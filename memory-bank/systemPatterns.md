# System Patterns: xvim

## System Architecture

xvim follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns, organized around these core principles:

### Layered Architecture

1. **Core Layer**: Fundamental data structures and algorithms
   - Text buffer representation
   - Document model
   - Memory management primitives

2. **Engine Layer**: Core editor functionality
   - Modal editing state machine
   - Command interpreter
   - Text manipulation operations
   - Motion and text object implementation
   - Selection and visual mode system

3. **UI Layer**: Interface components
   - Terminal UI rendering
   - Window management
   - Status line and command line interface
   - Syntax highlighting

4. **Extension Layer**: Plugin system
   - WASM runtime environment
   - Plugin API interfaces
   - Event dispatch system
   - Plugin lifecycle management
   - Advanced UI manipulation capabilities
   - Network access control system
   - Asynchronous operation support

### Component Isolation

Each major component is designed with clear boundaries and interfaces to ensure:
- Testability of individual components
- Ability to refactor internals without affecting other components
- Potential for alternative implementations of specific components

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Rust as Implementation Language**
   - Memory safety without garbage collection
   - Strong type system for correctness guarantees
   - Pattern matching for complex state handling
   - Zero-cost abstractions for performance
   - Excellent FFI capabilities for system integration

2. **WASM for Plugin System**
   - Language-agnostic plugin development
   - Sandboxed execution environment
   - Near-native performance
   - Standardized binary format
   - Growing ecosystem of tools and languages

3. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Reactive programming model for UI and plugins
   - Clear flow of information through the system
   - Decoupling of components via event bus
   - Support for asynchronous operations

4. **Configuration as Code**
   - .vimrc compatibility through interpreter
   - Strongly typed configuration options
   - Schema-based validation
   - Default values with clear override mechanisms

## Design Patterns in Use

1. **Command Pattern**
   - Encapsulates editor operations as command objects
   - Enables undo/redo functionality
   - Supports macro recording and playback
   - Allows for command composition

2. **Observer Pattern**
   - Event notification system for UI updates
   - Plugin hooks for editor events
   - Buffer change notifications

3. **Strategy Pattern**
   - Pluggable algorithms for text manipulation
   - Configurable behavior for editor operations
   - Customizable key mapping strategies

4. **Facade Pattern**
   - Simplified API surface for plugin developers
   - Abstraction of complex subsystems
   - Consistent interface across different editor components

5. **Factory Pattern**
   - Creation of buffer objects
   - Plugin instantiation
   - UI component generation

6. **Decorator Pattern**
   - Layered buffer modifications
   - Syntax highlighting
   - Text annotations and decorations

## Component Relationships

### Buffer Management System
- **Responsibility**: Manages text content and modifications
- **Relationships**:
  - Provides content to UI layer for rendering
  - Receives modification commands from the command interpreter
  - Notifies observers of changes
  - Exposes API for plugin access

### Modal Editing Engine
- **Responsibility**: Manages editor state and mode transitions
- **Relationships**:
  - Interprets key inputs based on current mode
  - Dispatches commands to buffer system
  - Updates UI based on mode changes
  - Provides context for command execution
  - Coordinates with selection system in visual modes
  - Manages transitions between normal, insert, and visual modes

### WASM Plugin Runtime
- **Responsibility**: Loads and executes WASM plugins
- **Relationships**:
  - Provides sandboxed environment for plugins
  - Exposes editor API to plugins
  - Manages plugin lifecycle
  - Enforces security boundaries
  - Facilitates network communication for AI services
  - Enables advanced UI manipulation for rich interfaces
  - Manages asynchronous operations and progress reporting

### Event System
- **Responsibility**: Facilitates communication between components
- **Relationships**:
  - Connects plugins to editor events
  - Enables UI updates based on state changes
  - Supports asynchronous operations
  - Provides extension points for custom events

### Configuration System
- **Responsibility**: Manages user preferences and settings
- **Relationships**:
  - Reads from .vimrc and other config files
  - Provides settings to all subsystems
  - Notifies components of setting changes
  - Validates and normalizes user input

### Text Editing Components

#### Buffer Management
- **BufferManager**: Central coordinator for all buffers
- **Buffer**: Represents a single text document
  - Uses Rope data structure for efficient text manipulation
  - Tracks file path, modification status, and other metadata
- **ChangeHistory**: Tracks changes for undo/redo functionality
  - Uses Command pattern for change operations
  - Groups related changes for atomic undo/redo

#### Cursor Management
- **CursorManager**: Handles cursor positioning and movement
- **CursorPosition**: Represents a position in the buffer
- Supports various movement operations (character, word, line)
- Maintains preferred column for vertical movement

#### Selection System
- **Selection**: Represents a text selection with start and end positions
- **SelectionType**: Defines selection modes (Character, Line, Block)
- **SelectionManager**: Coordinates selection operations
- Integrated with visual mode and cursor movement
- Supports operations on selected text (yank, delete, change)
- Handles normalization of selection boundaries

#### Mark System
- **Mark**: Named position in a buffer
- **MarkMap**: Collection of marks for a buffer
- Supports global and buffer-local marks
- Integrated with jump list for navigation

## Data Flow Patterns

1. **Input Processing Flow**
   - Key input → Mode interpreter → Command generation → Buffer modification → Selection update → UI update

2. **Plugin Execution Flow**
   - Editor event → Event dispatch → Plugin notification → Plugin execution → API calls → Editor state change

3. **Configuration Flow**
   - Config file parsing → Setting validation → Setting application → Component notification → Behavior adaptation

4. **Buffer Modification Flow**
   - Command execution → Change recording → Buffer modification → Change notification → UI update → Plugin notification

5. **Visual Mode Selection Flow**
   - Mode activation → Selection start → Cursor movement → Selection update → Operation execution → Mode exit

6. **AI Plugin Interaction Flow**
   - User input → Context gathering → API request formation → Asynchronous service call → Progress updates → Response processing → UI rendering

## Advanced Plugin Architectures

### PyroVim AI Agent Plugin

PyroVim represents an advanced use case for the WASM plugin system, requiring sophisticated capabilities:

1. **Split-Pane Interface**
   - Custom window management for input/output panes
   - Specialized buffer types with different behaviors
   - Real-time updating of output content
   - Custom keybindings within specific buffers

2. **AI Service Integration**
   - Secure network access to external AI services
   - Streaming response handling
   - Progress indication for long-running operations
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms

3. **Context Awareness**
   - Project structure analysis
   - Buffer content access
   - Cursor position tracking
   - Visual mode selection tracking
   - Integration with editor state and mode

4. **Component Structure**
   - Core plugin module for initialization and lifecycle
   - UI manager for window and buffer handling
   - AI service client for backend communication
   - Context provider for editor state access
   - Command executor for processing user inputs

This architecture demonstrates how the xvim plugin system can support sophisticated applications beyond traditional editor plugins, enabling new workflows that combine the efficiency of modal editing with the power of AI assistance.
