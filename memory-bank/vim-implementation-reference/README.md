# Vim Implementation Reference

This directory contains detailed analysis of Vim's source code to guide the implementation of xvim in Rust. The goal is to document key implementation details, algorithms, data structures, and behaviors that need to be preserved for compatibility.

## Purpose

- Provide a clear reference for porting Vim functionality to Rust
- Document complex behaviors and edge cases
- Identify performance-critical paths and optimization techniques
- Map C implementation patterns to idiomatic Rust equivalents

## Structure

This reference is organized by functional areas rather than directly mirroring the source file structure. Each markdown file focuses on a specific aspect of Vim's implementation:

1. **core-data-structures.md** - Key data structures used throughout Vim
2. **buffer-management.md** - How buffers are implemented and managed
3. **text-representation.md** - How text is stored, manipulated, and rendered
4. **modal-editing.md** - Implementation of Vim's modal editing system
5. **command-parsing.md** - How commands are parsed and executed
6. **window-management.md** - Window and viewport implementation
7. **plugin-system.md** - How Vim's plugin system works
8. **undo-redo.md** - Implementation of undo/redo functionality
9. **search-replace.md** - Text search and replace algorithms
10. **syntax-highlighting.md** - How syntax highlighting is implemented
11. **performance-optimizations.md** - Key performance techniques used in Vim

## Methodology

Each reference document follows this structure:

1. **Overview** - High-level description of the functionality
2. **Key Source Files** - List of relevant source files in Vim
3. **Data Structures** - Important structures and their purposes
4. **Algorithms** - Key algorithms and their implementation details
5. **Behaviors** - Specific behaviors that must be preserved
6. **Edge Cases** - Known edge cases and how they're handled
7. **Rust Implementation Considerations** - Notes on porting to Rust

## Usage

These reference documents should be consulted when:

1. Designing the corresponding components in xvim
2. Implementing specific features
3. Debugging compatibility issues
4. Making architectural decisions that might affect Vim compatibility
