# PyroVim: AI Agent Plugin for xvim

## Overview

PyroVim is an AI agent plugin for xvim that provides similar functionality to Roo-Code in VSCode. It integrates AI-powered code assistance, automation, and chat capabilities directly within the xvim editor. The plugin leverages xvim's WASM plugin system to create a seamless and powerful development experience.

## Core Features

1. **AI Chat Interface**
   - Split-pane interface activated via `:PyroChat` command
   - Bottom pane: Editable buffer for user prompts
   - Top pane: Output display for AI responses and automation progress
   - Ctrl-] keybinding to execute the prompt in the bottom pane

2. **Code Automation**
   - Code generation based on natural language descriptions
   - Automated refactoring and code improvements
   - Bug detection and fixing
   - Test generation

3. **Context-Aware Assistance**
   - Understanding of the current project structure
   - Access to open buffers and their content
   - Awareness of cursor position and selected text
   - Integration with version control information

4. **Backend Integration**
   - Support for multiple AI backends (similar to Roo-Code)
   - Configurable API keys and endpoints
   - Fallback mechanisms for service disruptions
   - Local model support where applicable

## UI Requirements

### Split-Pane Interface

The PyroVim interface requires:
- Dynamic window splitting capabilities
- Custom buffer types for input and output
- Real-time updating of the output buffer
- Syntax highlighting for both code and markdown in the output
- Scrollable history in the output pane
- Status line integration for showing processing state

### Input Buffer

- Editable buffer with command history
- Multi-line input support
- Syntax highlighting for prompts
- Command completion for common operations
- Special keybindings (Ctrl-] to execute)

### Output Buffer

- Markdown rendering capabilities
- Code block syntax highlighting
- Progress indicators for long-running operations
- Interactive elements (clickable links, expandable sections)
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality for generated code

## Plugin Architecture

### Component Structure

1. **Core Plugin Module**
   - Plugin initialization and lifecycle management
   - Command registration (`:PyroChat`, etc.)
   - Configuration management
   - Event handling

2. **UI Manager**
   - Window and buffer management
   - Input handling
   - Output rendering
   - Status updates

3. **AI Service Client**
   - Backend API communication
   - Request formatting
   - Response parsing
   - Error handling and retry logic

4. **Context Provider**
   - Project structure analysis
   - Buffer content access
   - Cursor and selection tracking
   - File system operations

5. **Command Executor**
   - Prompt parsing and preprocessing
   - Command routing
   - Execution monitoring
   - Result formatting

### Data Flow

1. User enters a prompt in the input buffer and presses Ctrl-]
2. The Command Executor parses the prompt
3. The Context Provider gathers relevant context
4. The AI Service Client sends the request to the backend
5. The UI Manager updates the output buffer with progress
6. The AI Service Client receives and processes the response
7. The Command Executor performs any requested actions
8. The UI Manager updates the output buffer with results

## WASM Plugin Runtime Requirements

To support PyroVim, the xvim WASM plugin runtime needs to provide:

### UI Capabilities

- **Window Management API**
  - Create, resize, and close windows
  - Split windows horizontally and vertically
  - Control window focus
  - Custom window decorations

- **Buffer Management API**
  - Create special buffer types
  - Control buffer properties (readonly, modifiable, etc.)
  - Buffer-specific keymaps
  - Real-time buffer updates

- **Rendering Extensions**
  - Markdown rendering
  - Syntax highlighting for multiple languages
  - Progress indicators and spinners
  - Interactive UI elements

### System Access

- **Network Access**
  - HTTP/HTTPS requests to AI backends
  - WebSocket support for streaming responses
  - Request cancellation
  - Rate limiting and retry mechanisms

- **File System Access**
  - Read project files for context
  - Write generated code to files
  - Create and modify configuration files
  - Access to temporary storage

- **Process Management**
  - Execute shell commands
  - Capture command output
  - Background process management
  - Signal handling

### Editor Integration

- **Event System**
  - Buffer change notifications
  - Cursor movement events
  - Mode change events
  - Command execution events

- **Editor State Access**
  - Current buffer and window information
  - Cursor position and selection
  - Register contents
  - Editor mode state

- **Command Integration**
  - Register custom commands
  - Intercept and modify command execution
  - Command completion hooks
  - Custom keybindings

### Concurrency and Performance

- **Asynchronous Execution**
  - Non-blocking API calls
  - Promise-like abstractions
  - Task scheduling and cancellation
  - Progress reporting

- **Memory Management**
  - Efficient handling of large responses
  - Streaming processing of data
  - Resource cleanup
  - Memory usage limitations

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Management**
   - Secure storage of API keys
   - Encryption of sensitive configuration
   - Isolation from other plugins

2. **Network Security**
   - TLS certificate validation
   - Request and response validation
   - Protection against request forgery

3. **Code Execution Boundaries**
   - Sandboxed execution of generated code
   - User confirmation for file modifications
   - Limits on automated actions

4. **Data Privacy**
   - Control over what context is sent to AI services
   - Options to exclude sensitive files/directories
   - Local processing options where possible

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1: Core UI and Command Infrastructure**
   - Implement the split-pane interface
   - Create the basic command structure
   - Establish buffer management for input/output

2. **Phase 2: AI Service Integration**
   - Connect to AI backends
   - Implement request/response handling
   - Add progress reporting

3. **Phase 3: Context Awareness**
   - Add project structure analysis
   - Implement cursor and selection tracking
   - Integrate with buffer content access

4. **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
   - Add code automation capabilities
   - Implement interactive UI elements
   - Add configuration and customization options

## WASM Plugin Runtime Implications

The requirements for PyroVim highlight several areas where the xvim WASM plugin runtime needs to be enhanced:

1. **Extended API Surface**
   - The plugin API needs to be significantly more comprehensive than initially planned
   - Need for deeper integration with editor internals

2. **Security Model Refinement**
   - More granular permission system for network and file access
   - User consent mechanisms for sensitive operations

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Handling of large data transfers between plugin and editor
   - Efficient rendering of complex UI elements

4. **Standardization**
   - Define clear interfaces for UI manipulation
   - Create consistent patterns for asynchronous operations
   - Establish conventions for plugin-to-editor communication

These requirements should inform the design and implementation of the xvim WASM plugin system to ensure it can support sophisticated plugins like PyroVim.
