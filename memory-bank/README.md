# xvim Memory Bank

This directory contains documentation that serves as the "memory bank" for the xvim project. It provides comprehensive context and documentation to help developers understand the project, its goals, and its current state.

## Purpose

The memory bank serves as a central repository of knowledge about the xvim project. It's designed to help developers:

1. Understand the project's goals and vision
2. Get up to speed on the technical architecture
3. Track the current state of development
4. Identify next steps and priorities
5. Maintain context across development sessions

## Files

### Core Documentation

- **[projectbrief.md](./projectbrief.md)**: Overview of the project, its goals, and key components
- **[productContext.md](./productContext.md)**: Product vision, target users, and user experience goals
- **[techContext.md](./techContext.md)**: Technical architecture, dependencies, and development environment
- **[systemPatterns.md](./systemPatterns.md)**: Design patterns and architectural decisions
- **[activeContext.md](./activeContext.md)**: Current focus, recent changes, and immediate next steps
- **[progress.md](./progress.md)**: Detailed tracking of implemented features, in-progress work, and future plans

### Additional Documentation

The memory bank may also include additional files for specific aspects of the project:

- Feature specifications
- API documentation
- Design decisions
- Meeting notes
- Research findings

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Read First**: When joining the project or returning after a break, read through the memory bank files to get up to speed.
2. **Update Regularly**: Update the memory bank files when making significant changes or decisions.
3. **Keep Accurate**: Ensure that the information in the memory bank is accurate and up-to-date.
4. **Cross-Reference**: Reference other memory bank files when appropriate to maintain a cohesive documentation set.

## Maintenance

The memory bank should be maintained alongside the codebase. When making significant changes to the code:

1. Update the `progress.md` file to reflect the new state of the project
2. Update the `activeContext.md` file to capture current focus and decisions
3. Update other files as needed to reflect changes in architecture, design, or goals

## Benefits

Maintaining the memory bank provides several benefits:

1. **Knowledge Preservation**: Captures important context and decisions that might otherwise be lost
2. **Onboarding**: Helps new developers get up to speed quickly
3. **Continuity**: Maintains project momentum across development sessions
4. **Alignment**: Keeps the team aligned on goals, priorities, and approach
5. **Documentation**: Serves as living documentation that evolves with the project

By keeping the memory bank up-to-date, we ensure that the xvim project remains well-documented and accessible to all contributors.
