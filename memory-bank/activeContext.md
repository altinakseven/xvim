# xvim Active Context

This document describes the current focus of development for the xvim project, highlighting recent work, active decisions, and immediate next steps.

## Current Focus

The current development focus is on enhancing the Ex command system to provide a more complete and user-friendly experience. This includes:

1. Improving the display of information for various commands
2. Enhancing error handling and user feedback
3. Implementing more comprehensive help documentation
4. Preparing for the implementation of Normal mode

## Recent Changes

### Development Environment Setup

We've installed the Rust toolchain to enable running Rust tests:

1. Installed rustup, the Rust toolchain installer
2. Installed the stable Rust toolchain (rustc 1.85.0, cargo 1.85.0)
3. Updated the run_tests.sh script to use Cargo for running tests instead of rustc directly

This setup provides a more robust testing environment that properly handles dependencies and ensures that the xvim crate is available to the test files.

### Visual Mode Implementation

We've implemented Visual mode, which is a core feature of Vim:

1. Character-wise visual mode (`v`)
2. Line-wise visual mode (`V`)
3. Block-wise visual mode (`Ctrl-V`)

The Visual mode implementation includes:
- Selection highlighting
- Visual mode operations (delete, yank, change)
- Reselecting previous visual area with `gv`
- Swapping selection corners with `o` and `O`
- Integration with the buffer system for storing visual areas
- Key mappings for entering and exiting Visual mode
- Proper handling of Visual mode state transitions

We've also added a comprehensive test file (visual_test.rs) that tests all Visual mode functionality, and updated the run_tests.sh script to include these tests.

### Plugin System Improvements

We've completely redesigned the NoxChat command to fix persistent cursor positioning issues:

1. Replaced the chat interface with a read-only information buffer
2. Simplified the command implementation to avoid cursor positioning and insert mode
3. Removed complex lock management that was causing deadlocks
4. Eliminated the need for window splitting and multiple buffers
5. Added clear error handling for the Ctrl-] key press
6. Set the buffer as read-only to prevent editing attempts
7. Added informative content about the AI functionality being under development
8. Streamlined the command execution flow to avoid race conditions

This approach completely avoids the cursor positioning issues that were causing the `Error: Buffer(BufferError(InvalidPosition))` error. Instead of trying to create a complex chat interface with input/output buffers, we now create a simple read-only information buffer that displays information about the xvim project and available commands.

### Normal Mode Enhancements

We've implemented search navigation in Normal mode, which is a key feature of Vim:

1. `/` - Forward search
2. `?` - Backward search
3. `n` - Find next occurrence
4. `N` - Find previous occurrence

The search functionality includes:
- Search history navigation
- Case-sensitive and case-insensitive search
- Result navigation with wrapping
- Integration with the command mode for entering search patterns

### Ex Command Enhancements

We've also enhanced several key Ex commands to provide more detailed and structured information:

1. `:jumps` - Now displays the jump list with current position marker, line, column, and file information
2. `:windows` - Now displays window dimensions, cursor position, and buffer information
3. `:tabs` - Now displays tab list with windows in each tab
4. `:help` - Now provides detailed help on various topics including commands, options, mappings, etc.

These enhancements make the editor more user-friendly and provide better visibility into the editor's state.

### Documentation

We've created comprehensive documentation for the project:

1. Project brief - Overview of the project goals and components
2. Technical context - Details of the technical implementation
3. System patterns - Design patterns and architectural decisions
4. Progress tracker - Current state of the project
5. Active context - Current focus and next steps

This documentation will help maintain project momentum and provide context for future development.

## Active Decisions

### Command Implementation Strategy

We're following a two-phase approach for command implementation:

1. **Phase 1**: Implement the command interface with proper parsing, error handling, and basic functionality
2. **Phase 2**: Enhance the command with full functionality and integration with other components

This allows us to build out the command system incrementally while maintaining a functional editor.

### UI Design

We're using a minimalist UI design that focuses on:

1. Clear presentation of information
2. Efficient use of screen space
3. Familiar Vim-like interface
4. High contrast for readability

### Error Handling

Our error handling strategy focuses on:

1. Clear error messages for users
2. Type-safe error handling with custom error types
3. Consistent error propagation through the Result type
4. Graceful recovery from errors when possible

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. ~~Complete the implementation of the `:read` command to fully insert file content~~ ✓ Completed
2. ~~Implement Visual mode selection and operations~~ ✓ Completed
3. ~~Implement Insert mode text entry~~ ✓ Completed
4. Begin work on the WASM plugin system
5. Enhance Visual mode with more text objects and operations
6. ~~Fix the compilation error in the plugin system related to the NoxChat command~~ ✓ Completed
7. ~~Implement proper window splitting for the NoxChat command~~ ✓ Completed
8. Fix the remaining compilation errors in the codebase to make the editor runnable
9. Address the numerous warnings throughout the codebase
=======

### Short-term Goals

1. Complete the core editing functionality (Normal, Insert modes)
2. Implement search and replace with regex support
3. Add syntax highlighting
4. Begin work on the WASM plugin system
5. Enhance Visual mode with more advanced features (block editing, etc.)

### Medium-term Goals

1. Implement multiple windows and tab pages
2. Add configuration system
3. Implement macros and marks
4. Add code folding and completion

## Technical Considerations

### Performance

We're monitoring performance in these areas:

1. Text editing operations (insert, delete, copy, paste)
2. Rendering large files
3. Search and replace operations
4. Plugin execution

### Memory Usage

We're optimizing memory usage by:

1. Using the rope data structure for efficient text storage
2. Minimizing allocations in hot paths
3. Using references instead of clones where possible
4. Implementing lazy loading for plugins

### Testing

Our testing strategy includes:

1. Unit tests for individual components
2. Integration tests for command functionality
3. Property-based testing for buffer operations
4. Manual testing for UI and user experience

## Collaboration Notes

- When implementing new commands, follow the pattern established in `src/command/handlers.rs`
- Document all public APIs with rustdoc comments
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update the progress tracker when completing features
