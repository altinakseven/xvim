# xvim Active Context

This document describes the current focus of development for the xvim project, highlighting recent work, active decisions, and immediate next steps.

## Current Focus

The current development focus is on enhancing the Ex command system and integrating Vim runtime files to provide a more complete and user-friendly experience. This includes:

1. Improving the display of information for various commands
2. Enhancing error handling and user feedback
3. Implementing more comprehensive help documentation
4. Preparing for the implementation of Normal mode
5. Integrating Vim runtime files for syntax highlighting, filetype detection, and other features

## Recent Changes

### Normal Mode Command Handling Improvements

We've significantly enhanced the Normal mode command handling in xvim to provide a more robust and extensible system:

1. Created a dedicated `normal_commands.rs` module to handle Normal mode commands
2. Implemented a comprehensive `NormalCommandHandler` class that manages:
   - Command registration and execution
   - Operator-pending mode
   - Motion commands
   - Text objects
   - Count prefixes for commands
   - Register selection
3. Added support for composable commands (operators + motions)
4. Integrated the command handler with the mode manager
5. Added methods to the Editor class to support the new command handling:
   - `insert_char` - Insert a character at the cursor position
   - `add_to_command_line` - Add a character to the command line
   - `replace_char` - Replace the character under the cursor
   - `send_to_terminal` - Send a character to the terminal
   - `repeat_search` - Repeat the last search
   - `join_lines` - Join multiple lines together

This new command handling system provides a solid foundation for implementing the full range of Vim's Normal mode commands. It follows Vim's composable command pattern, allowing operators (like delete, change, yank) to be combined with motions (like word, line, paragraph) and text objects (like word, sentence, paragraph, quoted text).

The system is designed to be extensible, making it easy to add new commands, operators, motions, and text objects as needed. It also properly handles count prefixes, allowing commands like `5dd` to delete 5 lines or `3w` to move forward 3 words.

### Vim Runtime Integration

We've integrated Vim runtime files into the xvim project to leverage Vim's extensive language support and configuration:

1. Created a runtime directory structure mirroring Vim's organization
2. Copied essential files from Vim's runtime directory:
   - Syntax highlighting definitions (runtime/syntax/*.vim)
   - Filetype detection (runtime/filetype.vim)
   - Filetype plugins (runtime/ftplugin/*.vim)
   - Indentation settings (runtime/indent/*.vim)
3. Added code to load these runtime files at editor startup
4. Enhanced the syntax module to dynamically load syntax definitions from runtime files

This integration allows xvim to benefit from Vim's extensive language support without having to reimplement everything from scratch. It also ensures compatibility with existing Vim configurations and plugins.

### Development Environment Setup

We've installed the Rust toolchain to enable running Rust tests:

1. Installed rustup, the Rust toolchain installer
2. Installed the stable Rust toolchain (rustc 1.85.0, cargo 1.85.0)
3. Updated the run_tests.sh script to use Cargo for running tests instead of rustc directly
4. Added auto-allowed commands to the settings to streamline development workflow:
   - All cargo commands (cargo build, cargo test, cargo run, etc.)
   - File system navigation commands (ls, ls -la, cd)
   - File operations commands (cp)

This setup provides a more robust testing environment that properly handles dependencies and ensures that the xvim crate is available to the test files. The auto-allowed commands help reduce friction during development by automatically approving commonly used commands without requiring manual confirmation.

### Visual Mode Implementation

We've implemented Visual mode, which is a core feature of Vim:

1. Character-wise visual mode (`v`)
2. Line-wise visual mode (`V`)
3. Block-wise visual mode (`Ctrl-V`)

The Visual mode implementation includes:
- Selection highlighting
- Visual mode operations (delete, yank, change)
- Reselecting previous visual area with `gv`
- Swapping selection corners with `o` and `O`
- Integration with the buffer system for storing visual areas
- Key mappings for entering and exiting Visual mode
- Proper handling of Visual mode state transitions

We've also added a comprehensive test file (visual_test.rs) that tests all Visual mode functionality, and updated the run_tests.sh script to include these tests.

### Plugin System Improvements

We've completely redesigned the NoxChat command to fix persistent cursor positioning issues:

1. Replaced the chat interface with a read-only information buffer
2. Simplified the command implementation to avoid cursor positioning and insert mode
3. Removed complex lock management that was causing deadlocks
4. Eliminated the need for window splitting and multiple buffers
5. Added clear error handling for the Ctrl-] key press
6. Set the buffer as read-only to prevent editing attempts
7. Added informative content about the AI functionality being under development
8. Streamlined the command execution flow to avoid race conditions

This approach completely avoids the cursor positioning issues that were causing the `Error: Buffer(BufferError(InvalidPosition))` error. Instead of trying to create a complex chat interface with input/output buffers, we now create a simple read-only information buffer that displays information about the xvim project and available commands.

### Normal Mode Enhancements

We've implemented search navigation in Normal mode, which is a key feature of Vim:

1. `/` - Forward search
2. `?` - Backward search
3. `n` - Find next occurrence
4. `N` - Find previous occurrence

The search functionality includes:
- Search history navigation
- Case-sensitive and case-insensitive search
- Result navigation with wrapping
- Integration with the command mode for entering search patterns

### Ex Command Enhancements

2. Technical context - Details of the technical implementation
3. System patterns - Design patterns and architectural decisions
4. Progress tracker - Current state of the project
5. Active context - Current focus and next steps

This documentation will help maintain project momentum and provide context for future development.

## Active Decisions

### Command Implementation Strategy

We're following a two-phase approach for command implementation:

1. **Phase 1**: Implement the command interface with proper parsing, error handling, and basic functionality
2. **Phase 2**: Enhance the command with full functionality and integration with other components

This allows us to build out the command system incrementally while maintaining a functional editor.

### UI Design

We're using a minimalist UI design that focuses on:

1. Clear presentation of information
2. Efficient use of screen space
3. Familiar Vim-like interface
4. High contrast for readability

### Error Handling

Our error handling strategy focuses on:

1. Clear error messages for users
2. Type-safe error handling with custom error types
3. Consistent error propagation through the Result type
4. Graceful recovery from errors when possible

## Next Steps
