## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Buffer Data Structure**
   - Considering rope-based implementation for efficient editing
   - Evaluating gap buffer alternatives for simpler implementation
   - Need to benchmark performance characteristics for large files

2. **Event System Design**
   - Evaluating pub/sub vs. callback approaches
   - Considering typed events vs. dynamic dispatch
   - Balancing flexibility with type safety

3. **Plugin API Design**
   - Determining granularity of plugin interfaces
   - Balancing compatibility with innovation
   - Defining security boundaries and capability model
   - Designing extended API for advanced UI manipulation
   - Planning asynchronous communication patterns for AI integration

4. **Split-Pane UI Architecture**
   - Designing flexible window management for PyroVim interface
   - Creating specialized buffer types for input/output panes
   - Planning real-time buffer update mechanisms

### Technical Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization Points**
   - Identifying critical paths for optimization
   - Establishing performance benchmarks
   - Defining acceptable performance thresholds

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Handling terminal differences across platforms
   - Managing filesystem path differences
   - Ensuring consistent behavior across environments

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Defining unit testing approach for core components
   - Planning integration tests for Vim compatibility
   - Creating property-based tests for correctness

### Open Questions

1. **Plugin System Scope**
   - How much of Neovim's API should be supported initially?
   - What limitations should be placed on plugin capabilities?
   - How to handle plugin dependencies and versioning?
   - What security model should be used for network access in plugins?

2. **Vim Compatibility Edge Cases**
   - How to handle Vim-specific behaviors that conflict with architectural goals?
   - What level of .vimrc compatibility is required?
   - How to test compatibility comprehensively?

3. **Development Priorities**
   - Should we prioritize core editing features or plugin system foundations?
   - When should we begin implementing UI components beyond basic terminal rendering?
   - How much effort should be invested in compatibility vs. innovation?

4. **AI Integration Challenges**
   - How to efficiently transfer large data between the editor and AI services?
   - What level of context awareness should be supported for AI plugins?
   - How to handle authentication and API key management securely?
   - What UI patterns should be established for AI interaction?
