## Recent Updates

### March 15, 2025
- Completed the implementation of the `:read` command to fully insert file content
- Improved window navigation with `:wnext` and `:wprev` commands
- Completely redesigned the `:noxchat` command to fix persistent cursor positioning issues:
  - Replaced the chat interface with a read-only information buffer
  - Simplified the command implementation to avoid cursor positioning and insert mode
  - Removed complex lock management that was causing deadlocks
  - Set the buffer as read-only to prevent editing attempts
  - Added informative content about the AI functionality being under development

### March 14, 2025
- Installed Rust toolchain (rustc 1.85.0, cargo 1.85.0) for running tests
- Updated run_tests.sh script to use Cargo for running tests instead of rustc directly
- Implemented Visual mode with character-wise, line-wise, and block-wise selection
- Added Visual mode operations (delete, yank, change)
- Implemented 'gv' command to reselect previous visual area
- Added 'o' and 'O' commands to swap selection corners
- Implemented search navigation (/, ?, n, N) with search history and result navigation
- Enhanced `:jumps` command to display jump list with current position marker
- Enhanced `:windows` command to display window dimensions and buffer information
- Enhanced `:tabs` command to display tab list with windows in each tab
- Enhanced `:help` command to provide detailed help on various topics
- Fixed issues with the NoxChat command in the plugin system:
  - Removed debug print statements to improve performance
  - Fixed potential deadlocks in the plugin command handling
  - Simplified the chat interface creation to avoid UI-related deadlocks

### Previous Updates
- Implemented basic Ex commands with proper error handling
- Set up project structure and core components
- Implemented buffer management system
- Created terminal UI framework

## Next Steps

1. Complete the implementation of Normal mode commands
2. ~~Implement Visual mode selection~~ âœ“ Completed
3. Implement Insert mode text entry
4. Begin work on the WASM plugin system
5. Add syntax highlighting support
6. Implement search and replace functionality
7. Add configuration system
8. Enhance Visual mode with more operations and text objects

## Known Issues

1. Some commands are implemented as stubs and need full implementation
2. Error handling could be improved in some areas
3. Need more comprehensive tests for edge cases
4. There are compilation warnings throughout the codebase that should be addressed
5. There are still persistent compilation errors in the codebase that need to be fixed before the editor can be run
6. The AI conversation functionality has been temporarily replaced with a read-only information buffer due to cursor positioning issues
