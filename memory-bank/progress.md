# Progress Tracking: xvim

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Foundation Phase (1/7)
**Overall Completion**: ~5%
**Current Sprint Focus**: Core Architecture Design

The project is in its initial setup and architecture design phase. We are establishing the foundational components and design patterns that will guide the implementation of the editor.

## What Works

As the project is in its early stages, the following components have been established:

1. **Project Structure**
   - Repository initialization
   - Documentation framework (Memory Bank)
   - Initial project planning

2. **Research and Analysis**
   - Vim architecture analysis complete
   - Rust implementation strategy defined
   - WASM plugin system approach researched
   - PyroVim AI agent plugin requirements defined

## What's In Progress

1. **Core Architecture Design**
   - Module structure definition
   - Component interface design
   - Data flow patterns

2. **Buffer Management System**
   - Text storage data structure design
   - Change tracking mechanism design
   - Initial implementation planning

3. **Modal Editing Engine**
   - State machine design
   - Command parsing strategy
   - Key mapping system design

## Known Issues

As the project is in its early stages, there are no implementation issues yet, but several challenges have been identified:

1. **Architectural Challenges**
   - Balancing Vim compatibility with modern design
   - Defining clean component boundaries
   - Managing complexity of modal editing state machine

2. **Technical Risks**
   - WASM plugin performance for complex operations
   - Terminal compatibility across platforms
   - Handling Vim's complex state management in a type-safe manner
   - Network security for AI service integration
   - Efficient handling of large data transfers for AI responses
   - Real-time UI updates for streaming responses

3. **Scope Considerations**
   - Extensive feature set of Vim creates large implementation scope
   - Compatibility requirements may conflict with architectural goals
   - Plugin API surface area is extensive

## Next Milestones

1. **Architecture Design Complete**
   - Finalized module structure
   - Component interfaces defined
   - Data flow patterns established
   - Expected completion: [Date TBD]

2. **Minimal Viable Editor**
   - Basic buffer editing
   - Normal and insert modes
   - Simple commands working
   - Terminal rendering functional
   - Expected completion: [Date TBD]

3. **WASM Plugin Prototype**
   - Simple plugin loading
   - Basic API surface
   - Proof-of-concept plugin
   - Expected completion: [Date TBD]

4. **PyroVim Prototype**
   - Basic split-pane interface
   - Simple AI service integration
   - Command execution framework
   - Expected completion: [Date TBD]

## Blockers and Dependencies

1. **No current external blockers**

2. **Internal Dependencies**
   - Buffer system must be implemented before modal editing engine
   - Event system needed for plugin architecture
   - Command parser required for configuration system

## Recent Achievements

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Project brief completed
   - Memory Bank documentation system established
   - Initial architecture research completed
