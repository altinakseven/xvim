# xvim Architecture

This document provides an overview of the xvim architecture and component relationships.

## Layered Architecture

xvim follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns, organized in layers:

### Core Layer

The Core Layer contains fundamental data structures and algorithms:

- Text buffer representation
- Document model
- Memory management primitives

### Engine Layer

The Engine Layer implements core editor functionality:

- Modal editing state machine
- Command interpreter
- Text manipulation operations
- Motion and text object implementation

### UI Layer

The UI Layer handles interface components:

- Terminal UI rendering
- Window management
- Status line and command line interface
- Syntax highlighting

### Extension Layer

The Extension Layer implements the plugin system:

- WASM runtime environment
- Plugin API interfaces
- Event dispatch system
- Plugin lifecycle management

## Component Relationships

### Buffer Management System

The Buffer Management System is responsible for:

- Managing text content and modifications
- Providing content to UI layer for rendering
- Receiving modification commands from the command interpreter
- Notifying observers of changes
- Exposing API for plugin access

### Modal Editing Engine

The Modal Editing Engine manages:

- Editor state and mode transitions
- Key input interpretation based on current mode
- Command dispatching to buffer system
- UI updates based on mode changes
- Context for command execution

### WASM Plugin Runtime

The WASM Plugin Runtime (future implementation) will:

- Provide sandboxed environment for plugins
- Expose editor API to plugins
- Manage plugin lifecycle
- Enforce security boundaries

### Event System

The Event System facilitates:

- Communication between components
- Connection of plugins to editor events
- UI updates based on state changes
- Support for asynchronous operations

## Data Flow

### Input Processing Flow

1. Key input → Mode interpreter → Command generation → Buffer modification → UI update

### Plugin Execution Flow (future)

1. Editor event → Event dispatch → Plugin notification → Plugin execution → API calls → Editor state change

### Buffer Modification Flow

1. Command execution → Change recording → Buffer modification → Change notification → UI update

## Implementation Details

The implementation uses Rust's type system and ownership model to ensure memory safety and correctness:

- Buffer data structures use the rope data structure for efficient text editing
- Mode handling uses a state machine pattern
- UI rendering uses crossterm for terminal manipulation
- Command parsing uses a simple parser for Vim-style commands

## Future Expansion

The architecture is designed to support future expansion:

- Full WASM plugin system
- Advanced UI capabilities
- Network-enabled plugins
- AI integration through plugins like PyroVim
